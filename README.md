# Union Hack :gb:

* What existing flags have you mashed up? Let's see.
* What (real or imaginary) places could you design flag(s) for? Let's see your sketches.
* How are you going to present your ideas, creative process and experiments next week (formative presentations)?
* What's your team GitHub repository? You may want to create an organisation (a GitHub group) for that..

### MAKE YOUR OWN FLAG

Keep it simple. The flag should be so simple that a child can draw it from memory.
Use meaningful symbolism. The flag’s images, colours, or patterns should relate to what it symbolises.
Use 2 or 3 basic colours. Limit the number of colours on the flag to three which contrast well and come from the standard colour set.
No lettering or seals. Never use writing on any kind or an organisation’s seal.
Be distinctive or be related. Avoid duplicating other flags, but use similarities to show connections.
